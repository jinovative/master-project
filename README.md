# Typing Test Web Service

A dynamic and feature-rich typing test platform designed to measure and improve typing skills with error analysis, personalized practice, and themed typing experiences.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project aims to create a scalable, user-friendly typing test web service that goes beyond basic speed measurement. The platform includes advanced features like error analysis, personalized practice modes, and user-generated content support, making it a comprehensive solution for enhancing typing proficiency.

### Features
- **Basic Typing Test**: Measure typing speed (WPM), accuracy, and error count.
- **Error Analysis**: Visualize typing weaknesses and suggest improvement areas.
- **Themed Typing Modes**:
  - Programmer Mode: Test with code snippets in various languages.
  - Language-Specific Tests: Typing exercises in English, Korean, and more.
  - Pop Culture Themes: Typing tests based on movie quotes or literature excerpts.
- **Real-Time Competition**: Live multiplayer mode using WebSocket.
- **DIY Self-Test Mode**: Upload and practice with custom text.
- **Custom Typing Tests**: Users can create and share their own typing challenges.
