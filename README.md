## ‚ú® Motivation

Before transitioning into computer science, I underwent wrist surgery, which made prolonged typing painful. During my programming journey, I often faced the challenge of adapting to new tools like ergonomic keyboards and balancing productivity with physical constraints. This experience inspired me to create a typing service that optimizes practice while integrating meaningful coding exercises.

### Broader Perspective:
- Many programmers face repetitive strain injuries due to extended typing sessions.
- Existing typing tools lack features tailored to coding needs, making practice inefficient for developers.

## üéØ Core Idea

The service aims to address the repetitive and tedious aspects of mastering coding fundamentals by combining typing practice with coding exercises.

### Unique Features:
1. **Integrating Real-World Programming Tasks**:
   - Users practice typing while reinforcing key coding concepts like sorting algorithms, data structure traversal, or async/await patterns.
2. **Optimizing Productivity**:
   - The dual focus on typing speed and coding mastery allows users to multitask effectively, saving time and reinforcing learning.
